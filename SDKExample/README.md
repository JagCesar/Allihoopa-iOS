# Allihoopa SDK example project

This is a test harness for the Allihoopa SDK. It is intended to be used in
conjunction with developing new SDK features or tracking down bugs.

To get the example up and running, you must first add real API credentials to
the project: copy the `SDKExample/Credentials.template.xcconfig` to
`SDKExample/Credentials.xcconfig` and insert your app key and secret into the
file.

Now, open `SDKExample.xcworkspace` and hit Run - everything should work out of
the box.
